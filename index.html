          <p>Hi, I'm currently enrolled in a Coding Bootcamp course. I'm learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
    
          <p>This website will serve as a building block for my education as well as my professional portfolio. In my studies I pursued photography where I became proficient in Adobe products such as Photoshop and Illustrator.</p>
    
          <p>I am interested in Front End web development as I hope to combine my inherent creative skills with my learned technical abilities in coding.</p>
